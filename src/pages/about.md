My journey in software engineering began with dropping out of college after one semester. I was recently married, and lost in terms of my next steps career-wise.

I needed to find a way to make a living, and quickly.

I learned about digital marketing, and saw that there was an entire community of people leveraging technology in order to earn a good salary. All one had to do, was gain the necessary skills, and objectively prove that they could provide value.

## It all began with one HTML tag...

After having made my first WordPress website. I wanted to learn about how to make a websites from scratch. I found an entire HTML course from The New Boston on YouTube. The rest is history ðŸ¥°.

## Where I am now

After teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, I was able to find a job in tech. I am currently learning React, Astro, Node, and Express.

I'm getting funny ideas and want to add something powerful like C# and ASP.NET to my toolbelt. I'll probably let you know on one of my posts ðŸ˜‰.
