## So, what is a Database?

A database is a collection of data that is organized and stored in a structured way. It allows for easy retrieval, manipulation, and management of data. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of data, such as customer information, product inventory, and website content.

There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.

## SQL Databases

SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are the most common type of databases. They use a predefined schema, which means that the structure of the data, such as the tables and columns, must be defined in advance. This allows for a clear and consistent structure to the data, making it easier to query and manipulate.

SQL databases are also based on the relational model, which means that data is organized into related tables. This allows for the creation of relationships between different pieces of data, such as one-to-many or many-to-many. This makes it easier to query and retrieve data from multiple tables at once.

One of the most popular SQL databases is MySQL. It is an open-source database management system that is widely used for web applications and websites. Other popular SQL options include PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server.

## NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not have a predefined schema and do not use the relational model. They are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, and can scale easily to handle large amounts of data and concurrent users. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Firestore DB and Cassandra. 

## Getting started for free

To learn more about databases, there are many resources available for learning and getting started for free. Here are some ways to get started with each database technology mentioned in this blog post:

- **MySQL:** MySQL offers a variety of resources including documentation, tutorials, and a developer community. Some of the popular resources include the MySQL website (https://www.mysql.com/) and the MySQL community forum (https://community.mysql.com/)

- **MongoDB:** MongoDB offers free MongoDB University courses, which include interactive lessons and hands-on exercises. You can access the courses at https://university.mongodb.com/courses/catalog

- **Firestore DB:** Firebase website offers tutorials, documentation and resources for using Firestore DB, and also offers a free plan. You can access the resources at https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore
